//! # Yew Styles
//!
//! Yew Styles is a style framework for yew
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! The purpose of developing this project is first,
//! provide a style framework for yew because there isn't not many options currently,
//! also to create a layout system which is not far of the flexbox concept, and,
//! to take the rust benefits and implement a properties selected by enumeration
//! in the most of the cases which makes fast for developing applications and avoids the practice try and error
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! Each component is split in two parts, the logical yew component and its sass module,
//! however, it is not necessary to worry about the sass module only it needs to be include in the project
//!
//! ### How install it
//!
//! 1. Install the sass module: `npm install yew-styles`
//! 2. Add the yew_style crate with the features needed for your project in Cargo.toml file:
//! ```toml
//! yew_styles = { version="0.6.0", features=["button", "navbar", "layouts"]}
//! ```
//! 3. Import the main.css file in you main javascript/typescript file project:
//! ```typescript
//!    import 'node_modules/yew-styles/main.css';
//! ```
//! 4. Ready to import and use in your project ðŸš€
//!
//! ## Development phase
//!
//! Yew style is in early phase, currently doesn't have enough components to cover all the requirements that could need a website/web application.
//! All contributions are appreciated.
//!
//! ## How contribute
//! First, open an issue describing about the fix, improvement or implementation and as suggestion, don't start to work in it until that is discussed.
//! If the contribution is a fix or small improvement in a component, only a pull request to master explaining what resolve or improve that, is required.
//! If it is an implementation, please follow the next requirements:
//!
//! * Firstable open and issue describing about the component
//! * Unit tests, which checks that the component is created and
//! its logic works, in the same file where it is implemented (test events is not needed for now)
//! * One component per file, if multiple components have connections between them, it is possible create subfolder
//! * Documentation in the component showing an example of using it and small description of each prop
//! * Create a component page in `/crate/src/page` with the same structure than the rest of the components
