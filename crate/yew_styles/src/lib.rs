//! # Yew Styles
//!
//! Yew Styles is a style framework for [yew](https://yew.rs/docs/en/intro/) without JavaScript dependencies
//!
//! ## Motivation
//! The purpose of developing this project is first,
//! provide a style framework for yew that doesn't require any JavaScript dependencies
//! also to create a layout system which is not far of the flexbox concept, and,
//! to take the rust benefits and implement properties selected by enumeration
//! in the most of the cases which makes fast for developing applications and avoids the practice try and error
//!
//! ## How it works
//! Each component is split in two parts, the logical yew component and its sass module,
//! however, it is not necessary to worry about the sass module only it needs to be include in the project
//!
//! ### How install it
//! 1. Install the sass module: `npm install yew-styles`
//! 2. Add the yew_style crate with the features needed for your project in Cargo.toml file:
//! ```toml
//! yew_styles = { version="0.9", features=["button", "text", "navbar"] }
//! ```
//! 3. Import the main.css file in you main javascript/typescript file project:
//! ```typescript
//!     import 'node_modules/yew-styles/main.css';
//! ```
//! 4. Ready to import and use in your project ðŸš€
//!
//! ## Run the documentation page
//! 1. `git clone https://github.com/spielrs/yew_styles.git`
//! 2. `cd yew_styles`
//! 3. `npm start`
//!
//! In the left side there is a list of links where each one access to a correspondent component documentation,
//! there, shows how to use it.
//!
//! ## Run the tests
//! Inside of the project run:
//!
//! `cargo test --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --manifest-path=crate/yew_styles/Cargo.toml`
//!
//! ## Development phase
//! Yew Styles cover all the common cases used in a web application however there are still a lot of work to do and components to implement.
//! All contributions are appreciated.
//!
//! ## How contribute
//! First, open an issue describing about the fix, improvement or implementation and as suggestion, don't start to work in it until that is discussed.
//! If the contribution is a fix or small improvement in a component, only a pull request to master explaining what resolve or improve that, is required.
//! If it is an implementation, please follow the next requirements:
//!
//! * Firstable open and issue describing about the component
//! * Unit tests, which checks that the component is created and
//! its logic works, in the same file where it is implemented (test events is not needed for now)
//! * One component per file, if multiple components have connections between them, it is possible create subfolder
//! * Documentation in the component showing an example of using it and small description of each prop
//! * Create a component page in `/crate/src/page` with the same structure than the rest of the components
